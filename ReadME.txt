# World Clock - Bash Script

Welcome to the World Clock Bash script repository! This simple script allows you to check the current time for a specific city using the TimezoneDB API.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Bash and `curl` installed on your system.
- You need a TimezoneDB API key. Get it [here](https://timezonedb.com/register).

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MngomaZAR/world-clock-bash.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd world-clock-bash
    ```

3. Open the script (`world_clock.sh`) in a text editor and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual TimezoneDB API key.

4. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x world_clock.sh
    ```

### Running the Script

- Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./world_clock.sh
    ```

- Follow the prompts to enter the city you want to check.

### Example

```bash
Welcome to the World Clock!

Enter the city to check the current time: New York

Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual TimezoneDB API key.

How to Run:

Save the script to a file, e.g., world_clock.sh.
Make the script executable: chmod +x world_clock.sh.
Run the script: ./world_clock.sh.
Explanation:

The script uses the TimezoneDB API to fetch time zone information based on the user-entered city.
The get_timezone_data function makes a curl request to the API and uses jq to extract the time zone.
The display_city_time function sets the time zone using TZ and fetches the current time for the specified city.
The user is prompted to enter a city, and the script displays the current time for that city.
This is a basic example, and you can extend and enhance it based on your specific requirements and preferences.
